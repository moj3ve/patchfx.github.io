I have just finished wrapping up milestone two. In terms of the code, it
contained 3x the amount of changes than in the first milestone. Visually it
doesn't seem like a lot was done at all. It felt like I did a fair bit of
['Yak Shaving'](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/yak_shaving) Being solo it's
difficult to juggle the art requirements as well as code, which usually end up
blocking each other. I enjoy the coding way more than the art, so I have
enlisted some help in order to speed up that pipeline and enable me to focus on
the part that I'm good at, or at least enjoy the most. This caused a little bit
of a delay, so I got stuck into building a lot of the backend framework that
would accomodate the art.

# Summarising the completed tasks
The player now has a reputation which is positively impacted by completing
orders and negatively impacted by refusing them. Financial transactions are
handled on successful completion of orders. Items are loaded via a JSON file
containing their name, description, value, difficulty and artwork. Music and
sound effects have been added to bring a little more life to game.

# What this builds upon
Some of the tasks above have the underlying code but have no visual
representation in the game. In the next milestone I will be adding a HUD,
crafting dialog with player inventories. The crafting side will use the new
expertise and item difficulty to simulate the success or failure of creating
a new item.

Hopefully I will have a few more visuals to show in the next update. You can

indie game related things. Also there is a mailing list signup below!
