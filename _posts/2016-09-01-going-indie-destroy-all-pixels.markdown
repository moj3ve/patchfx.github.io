The summer is drawing to a close and I'm ready to announce the game I have been
working on for the last few months. For those that know me well, I've been
involved in the games development scene for quite a few years, from tinkering
with [toy projects](http://github.com/patchfx) to working on a more ambitious
project with a friend of mine, [Sol Trader](http://soltrader.net). The latter
project has very much inspired me to realise a dream of mine and ship a game of
my own (solo). I'm certainly not ambitious enough to take on as large a project, but
wanted to move beyond the typical game jam style games that I have created to date.

# A bit about me

I have been a software developer since the age of 16, when I left secondary
school (high school for those in the States) and went to London to work for
a stock market software company. I was developing in Python and took a night
course in Java. A few years later I left and went to do a Games Development
degree at the [University of Glamorgan](http://glam.ac.uk), graduated and landed
a job at Eden Development. The last 8 years have been spent predominantly doing web
related work, mostly with Ruby and Javascript. More recently I've been using
Rust, a really great systems programming language which I've grown to like
a lot. Developing an OpenGL app with it really sparked something that I hadn't
felt for quite some time, the need to create my own games.

# About the game

I have spent the last few months gradually working through my backlog and
handing off other responsibilities to people around me, in order to free up more
time to do games. I'm aiming for 1 day a week full time with some evenings and
weekends thrown in. This intentionally limits the scope of my first project
which I definitely think is a good thing. I've seen way to many games get
abandoned over the years including plenty of my own. This is something I want to
avoid.

I've had a game idea brewing in my mind for over year, which I've recently
started to prototype over the last few months. The game is a medieval blacksmith
management sim. You receive orders, fulfill them, manage employees as well as
resources.

Currently I have just completed my first milestone, a fairly simple game engine
with asset loading, update loop and rendering pipeline. You can receive, accept,
reject and fulfill orders. Milestone 2 will include more items to order, money
exchanges, reputation, crafting difficulty and some basic sound fx and music.
I'm hoping that will be enough to get an early alpha version released. I'm
extremely keen to get as much feedback early on as possible.

# What's next?

I'll be treating this as a dev blog, I'll create a separate website for the
game, once I have a name that sticks. I'm planning on updating as much as I can,
partly as a journal of sorts as well as some accountability. Starting projects
is easy, finishing them is hard. Encouragement is very much appreciated!
