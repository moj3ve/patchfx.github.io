Thanks for checking out my blog!

I've been a software developer for just over 12 years (as of 2020).
In that time I've worked with startups as well as large companies in
various and diverse industries. I code mostly in Rust, Ruby and
Javascript.

I work on [open source](https://github.com/patchfx) as well as
[indie games](https://soltrader.net). I'm a drummer in
[The Bright Expression](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5bWmvAR4w5M4e9zMYcQmdO)
and have toured Europe and received radio play on BBC, it's a
fun distraction.

I enjoy writing tech articles around Rust, AI, Machine Learning
and games development.
